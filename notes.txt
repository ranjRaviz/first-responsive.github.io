----- Grid System -----

- 2 rules to remember:
    (1) Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding.
    E.g.: <div class="container">
    (2) Only columns may be immediate children of rows.



- Relative links. E.g.: /html/grid.html
- Absolute links. E.g.: http://www.google.com

----- Spans -----

- Spans help style inline elements.



----- Centering Block Elements -----

- There's a big difference when centering inline elements with block elements.
- In order to center a block element, for example hr, is to give it a margin on
the left and a margin on the right of auto. E.g.: margin: 15px auto;
- If the block element, <hr> tag is inside a block element with styling as
text-align: center;, the hr tag will inherit the styling of center.



- Consider styling per container or section of the page.



----- Pseudo Class -----

- A sample of a psuedo class is a:hover, wherein :hover is a sudo class of a tag.
- Opacity is transparency, you can scale from 0 to 1. 1 is not transparent at all.



----- Beautification Through Background Colors -----

- Wrap the container class div to another container and add a specific
class to apply a custom styling. E.g.: background-color



----- All About IDs -----

- ID as a link. IDs are used as values for a tag. E.g.: href="#get-involved-con"
- You could do href="grid.html#get-involved", it it's from another page.



----- Media Queries -----

- Setup the media queries for medium devices. Set the max-width to 1199px so that
the elements will adjust within the max width of 1199px, avoiding the min width of
large devices which is 1200px.
- Setup the media queries for small devices from 991px (max) to 768px. Set the max width
to 991px because the max width of medium device is 992px.
- Setup the media queries for extra small devices by setting the width to 400px, which
is the smallest possible.



----- Getting Your Site Live With Github -----

- Create a new repository name the same as your username to be able to make your
personal domain. E.g.: https://ranjraviz.github.io/
